    Note for Irshaad (05/12/2023 {DD/MM/YYYY}):
        Please don't forget to do this.
		It's the AE plan we've been talking about for over a month now.
		Just do it already.

        - Events:
            - Make the ability to put zero, one, two and more inputs in an event [In Progress]
        - Characters:
            - Rewrite how Character JSONS are read
            - Add Character Indexes (Helps for more than one alt animation) [In Progress]
            - Add Character Index Names (Just an alternative method) [In Progress]
            - Make Event specific for this
            - Keep AE's script of reading Psych (and probably Leather)'s Char Json files
            - Still have AE have the ability to read an AE Json File
            - Let AE have the ability to still write a Char JSON file like a Psych Char Json file
            - Add the ability to write an AE Char JSON file
        - Char Editor:
            - Add a scroll for the list of anims
            - Add the index name anims
            - Refreshen the thing up a bit wouldja'?
            - Figure out a way to import chart editor files using text input and dragging the chart file into the application will automatically import it for you
